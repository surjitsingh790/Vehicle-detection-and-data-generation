# Vehicle detection and data generation
We collected numbers of videos at different locations to collect real data.

Performed ETL process to extract metadata and performed data cleaning. 

Used computer vision model YOLOv3 for object (Vehicle) detection (Deep Learning).

Tracked vehicle motion and detected numbers of vehicles, generated datafiles of upward and downward moving vehicles.

Created and deployed web application to show traffic of different locations at different time by merging the extracted data with the sample data of Uber in New York to enhance feature experience of the app.
